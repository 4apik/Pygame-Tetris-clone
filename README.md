# Pygame-Tetris-clone

When I started writing this one I didn't know anything about how other people did it,
so there is no grid or prepared shapes in all of their possible positions.

Instead I came up with idea of creating four square sprites and attaching them to each other randomly
to make a shape. It caused some struggle with rotating it later, but it works :)

One strange thing is that sometimes it spawns the same shape 3-4 time in a row, which is technically possible,
but still odd.

There are some sound effects and background music.
Press Esc to close the game window.

Looks like that:
